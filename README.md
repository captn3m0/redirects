# redirects

This is the "temporary" successor to https://github.com/captn3m0/lightsaber,
which was great but required an always on well-configured server to run.

This uses [Netlify's Redirect](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/)
feature to configure redirects for my "interesting URLs".

This relies on Jekyll / Liquid Templating to generate the required redirects.
